    '''This function runs Velocity Verlet algorithm to integrate the positions and velocities of atoms interacting through
    Lennard Jones Potential forward for one time step according to Newton's Second Law.
    Inputs:
    sigma: the distance at which Lennard Jones potential reaches zero, float
    epsilon: potential well depth of Lennard Jones potential, float 
    positions: current positions of all atoms, 2D array of floats with shape (N,3) where N is the number of atoms, 3 is x,y,z coordinate
    velocities: current velocities of all atoms, 2D array of floats with shape (N,3) where N is the number of atoms, 3 is x,y,z coordinate
    dt: time step size, float
    m: mass,float
    Outputs:
    new_positions: new positions of all atoms, 2D array of floats with shape (N,3) where N is the number of atoms, 3 is x,y,z coordinate
    new_velocities: new velocities of all atoms, 2D array of floats with shape (N,3) where N is the number of atoms, 3 is x,y,z coordinate
