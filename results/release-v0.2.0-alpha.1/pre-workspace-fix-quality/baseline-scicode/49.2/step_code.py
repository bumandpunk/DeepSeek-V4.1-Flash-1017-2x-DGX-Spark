def Nbody_RHS(uin, mass):
    '''This function computes the right hand side for the evolution equation of a $N$ particle system evolving under gravity. It takes as input the current state $uin$, and mass $mass$.
    Inputs:
    uin: a 2D array of initial positions and velocities. N,6 elements; each element is a float; each particle is described by its location and velocity, first the $x$,$y$,$z$ position of the particle followed by the $vx$,$vy$,$vz$ velocity of the partile. Thus particle "i"'s position and velocity are stored in uin[i][0],uin[i][1],uin[i][2],uin[i][3],uin[i][4],uin[i][5].
    mass: an 1D array of particle masses; an array of floats
    Outputs:
    rhs: a 2D array of velocities and accelerations, N,6 elements; each element is a float; laid out as $vx$, $vy$, $vz$, $ax$, $ay$, $az$.
